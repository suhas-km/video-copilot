  "summary": "Retention is engineered by managing viewer cognitive load, leveraging dopamine feedback loops, and maintaining attention through strategic pacing. The human brain filters for relevance - viewers don't lack attention span, they lack relevant stimulation.",
  "core_principles": [
    {
      "principle": "Dopamine Loop and Novelty Bias",
      "description": "The brain releases dopamine when encountering novel visual stimuli or correctly predicting outcomes. This creates a reward cycle that reinforces continued watching.",
      "importance": "high"
    },
    {
      "principle": "Cognitive Load Management",
      "description": "Under-stimulation causes boredom (click away), over-stimulation causes fatigue (quit). Optimal retention occupies a 'flow state' between extremes with dynamic pacing.",
      "importance": "high"
    },
    {
      "principle": "3-5 Second Habituation Threshold",
      "description": "Visual stasis leads to brain disengagement. Static shots longer than 3-5 seconds cause attention drift. Visual novelty (pattern interrupts) re-engages predictive processing.",
      "importance": "high"
    },
    {
      "principle": "Click-Satisfaction Gap",
      "description": "Viewers click with specific value expectations. If video doesn't validate that expectation immediately (first frame), cognitive dissonance causes abandonment.",
      "importance": "high"
    },
    {
      "principle": "First 30-Second Drop-off",
      "description": "Statistically, most viewer drop-off occurs in first 30 seconds. This is the 'churn phase' where retention hooks must grab attention before viewer evaluates value.",
      "importance": "medium"
    },
    {
      "principle": "Breathing Room for Consolidation",
      "description": "Over-editing causes cognitive exhaustion. Strategic use of lower visual density moments (3-5 seconds post-climax) allows information processing and emotional resonance.",

    {
      "name": "Dynamic Pacing Strategy",
      "description": "Oscillate between fast editing (engages thinking brain/neocortex) and slow shots (engages feeling brain/limbic system) to prevent fatigue while maintaining engagement.",
      "implementation": [
        "Speed up during information-dense segments",
        "Slow down for emotional processing or emphasis",
        "Use rhythm that mirrors natural attention fluctuations"
